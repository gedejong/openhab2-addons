# Buienradar Binding

The Buienradar Binding periodically (5 minute intervals) retrieves rainfall predictions from the Dutch buienradar.nl webservice API.

This allows us to warn of upcoming rainfal when there are still open windows, or prevents watering the outside plants needlessly. 

## Supported Things

The webservice supports one thing, which can be added manually via the web interface. The thing needs longitude and latitude of the location which needs forecasts.

## Discovery

No auto-discovery is possible.
